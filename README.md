# GHGPredictor

This model predicts **GHG Emissions per Vehicle** for multiple vehicle companies by combining:
- **Historical data from 2020–2022**, and
- **Sentiment extracted from the company’s 2023 sustainability report (.txt)**

The app also computes **R²** to quantify how well predictions align with the **actual 2023** GHG/vehicle values.
